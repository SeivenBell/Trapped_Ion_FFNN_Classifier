Creation of FFNN for trapped ions state classification 
exlanation:
What do we do in ionsFNNv2.py:

This code defines two classes and some training setup. Here's what each part does:

1. `IonDataset` class: This is a custom PyTorch `Dataset` that's used to load and preprocess your data. It reads a file in the HDF5 format, which is a format designed to store and organize large amounts of data. For each key in the file, it retrieves the associated image, converts it into a tensor, adds a dimension (using `unsqueeze(0)`), and appends it to the `data` list. It also determines the label for each image based on the key name, converts it into a tensor, and appends it to the `labels` list.

2. `FFNN` class: This is a simple feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model. It takes an input of size 5*5, applies a linear transformation followed by a ReLU activation function, and then applies another linear transformation. The output size is 2, representing the two classes of your classification problem (bright and dark states).

3. The rest of the code is setting up and preparing for training the model:
   - The paths to the data files are set.
   - The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set, with 80% of the data used for training and the rest for validation.
   - The training and validation data are loaded into `DataLoader`s, which are PyTorch utilities that help iterate over the data in batches.
   - The model is instantiated and moved to the GPU if one is available.
   - The loss function (cross-entropy loss) is set up with class weights to handle class imbalance.
   - The optimizer (Adam) and the learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau) are set up.

4. The `validate` function: This function is used to evaluate the model on the validation set. It calculates the loss and the accuracy of the predictions, both overall and separately for the bright and dark classes. The `model.eval()` line tells PyTorch to set the model to evaluation mode, which turns off features like dropout that are used during training but not during evaluation. The `with torch.no_grad():` block tells PyTorch not to calculate gradients during the following operations, since we're not going to be doing backpropagation (which is not needed during evaluation).
